At least two courses focuses on MIPS, so we've moved some content from individual courses to this page.

- Beginner: for [inf2c-cs](/inf2#inf2c-cs)
- Advanced: for [ct](/inf3#ct) people

There's also [myMars - a custom version of Mars with some minor additional features](https://github.com/qaisjp/myMARS/releases).
