Thinking about making a pull request?

You don't need to! Just make an issue asking to be added as a contributor, and we'll add you!

Please only make pull requests if:
- you're changing the overall structure
- you're changing the design of the entire website
- you want points for Hacktoberfest, or something like that

Thank you!
