## Honesty Jar notes

Milk (non-dairy and dairy) is subsidised by Informatics. You need to keep receipts and fill in some forms. Or just ask Qais to stock up.

So the rule of thumb so far is:
- if it's perishable & immeasurable (i.e. milk), it doesn't get put on the price list
- individual stuff like cans of coke, chocolate bars, etc, DOES get put on the price list
- if you buy something for the floor, and you're certain it does get used
  (or if you're unsure, observe it getting used), feel free to
  deduct the cost from the Honesty Jar Bank of Informatics!
- super cheap stuff shouldn't get put on the price list. let's say the minimum spend is 10p for now?
