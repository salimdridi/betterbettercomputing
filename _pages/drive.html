<p>Better Informatics' server is down right now, so we're currently hosting on GitHub Pages instead.</p>
<p>This means we can't use our little webapp to automatically add you to the Drive.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=" id="temp-drive-link">
        If you're already a member of the Drive, click here to continue.
    </a></li>
    <li>
        If you are not already a member of the Better Informatics Shared Drive,
        email <a href="mailto:admin@betterinformatics.com">admin@betterinformatics.com</a> and ask for access. Make sure you:

        <ol>
            <li>write "Better Informatics is down: please manually add me to Google Drive" as your subject,</li>
            <li>send the email from your university email address, so we know you are a student, and</li>
            <li>include the email address of your Google account, so that you actually get access to the Drive.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
