## Where is my course?
Each course is put in a folder with the year that Informatics lists the course to be run for. You can view all courses and their associated years at course.inf.ed.ac.uk.

## Sharing

When you share a link (see types of links below), only people who are added to the Better Informatics Team Drive have access.

| Type    | Example URL                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Folders | [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/**0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA)                                             |
|   Files | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/**1W1xVJs_RvV3KBbk1bKjsDvYUyUitER4jVbuae-nUFx8**/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1xVJs_RvV3KBbk1bKjsDvYUyUitER4jVbuae-nUFx8/edit) |

If you share one of the above links directly, users without access will be presented with the below interface:

  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DYAMx8o.png">
    <img alt="Google Drive request access" src="https://i.imgur.com/DYAMx8ol.png">
  </a>
</center>

**This is bad!** There is an automated system to add users to the Team Drive.


You can just click the <a href="/drive" style="padding: 0 0.5em;" class="btn"><strong>join team drive</strong></a> link at the top, and this will just prompt you to log in and associate your
Informatics DICE account (to prove you're an inf student) with a Google account (to use Google Drive).

**If you would like to directly send a link to someone in a group chat**... copy the bolded bit in the URLs above and paste
it in the section indicated below by `ID_HERE`:


```
https://betterinformatics.com/drive?next=ID_HERE
```

For example, the following URL `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA` would
produce `https://betterinformatics.com/drive?next=0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA`.

(todo: replace these annoying instructions with a little edit box that auto-converts it for you)

## Statistics

As of 2020-02-04 we had 2025 users registered on our Google Drive. We may have had _more_ registrations, but that's the
number of people who hadn't removed themselves from the drive at the time. On this day we reset the entire list and
requested people to rejoin. This is so that they [change this setting](https://imgur.com/a/x3U6g2x).
