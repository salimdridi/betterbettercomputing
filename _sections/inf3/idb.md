_Previously named Database Systems (DBS)_

- Questions and answers from the DBS textbook - [link](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/openAccess/thirdEdition/solutions/ans3ed-oddonly.pdf)
- [Normalization tool](http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/~jw/normalization/ind.php)
- [Revision notes by Ben Shaw](https://github.com/benshaaw/revision/tree/master/DBS)
- [Functional dependency closure / key finder / minimal cover / 3NF & BCNF checker tool](https://ka.ge/fdtool) ([source](https://github.com/pkage/fdtool))
- [Relational algebra calculator / engine](https://dbis-uibk.github.io/relax/), [example schema definition for tutorial 1](https://gist.github.com/Visgean/8467b0196f9d88be8b2a8da890a7433a)
- Exam tips:
  - Don't forget semicolons, they will knock marks off for this!
  - They want to see efficient solutions!
  - [Derivation using the Armstrongâ€™s axioms](https://i.imgur.com/6naWb9G.png): all steps and axioms in your derivation should be clearly mentioned
    - It's also worth understanding that there could be multiple correct proofs for a given implication so detailed explanations would make it easier for marker 
  - Relational algebra questions: consider how your answer behaves when certain relations are empty (tutorial 1, question 3)
- Relational algebra FAQ:
  - Operations only return unique tuples. That means if you project on a single column, each row will be unique. This is because (definition) _"Relations (tables) are **sets** of records of the same length"_
- easily consumable stuff by b0rk:

  - [how sql joins work](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1177611875535790087?lang=en)
- SQL to XXX FAQ (for those with experience in SQL/NoSQL)
  - Relational algebra:
    - project (pi)
      - <code>select <strong>id, name, city</strong> from customers;</code>
      - RethinkDB (NoSQL) people will know this as [`.pluck`](https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/pluck)
    - select (sigma)
      - <code>select * from customers where <strong>name = 'Alice' or name = city</strong></code>
      - RethinkDB (NoSQL) people will know this as [`.filter`](https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/filter)
  - Unknowns / `NULL`
    - `Unknown` is represented as `NULL` in SQL,
    - `unknown = unknown` is really `NULL = NULL`,
    - all comparisons where at least one of the arguments is `NULL`, evaluates to unknown (which, again, is `NULL`).
