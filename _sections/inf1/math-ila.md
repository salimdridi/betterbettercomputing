> _the maths exams are open book, so take in past paper solutions (with an index)
  as they reuse questions a lot. they might not necessarily be the same,
  but they'll likely be close enough to give you a hand_

-   **Poole textbook**: The Nicholson textbook is fairly hard to learn from, so it may be worth finding a copy of David Poole's *Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction*, as it is much better at explaining concepts.
-   [No bullshit concept maps](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/conceptmap.pdf) good for seeing the big picture in the course
-   [Linear algebra explained in 4 pages](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/linear_algebra_in_4_pages.pdf) good resource to give you general idea. Might be worthwhile to go through it before the start of the course.
-   [Explanatory videos from Mathapptician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yJY2NrVL0&list=PL9NlTZRdFADdc4yn_OVDpv-2pDiOKU7KH&index=3)
-   [Khan Academy videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
-   [Essence of Linear Algebra (videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) by 3blue1brown - covers a large part of the course and gives greatly intuitive ways of understanding what the formulae really represent
-   Answers for Poole ([3rd edition], [4th edition])
-   [Symbolab](https://www.symbolab.com/) has extremely good support for linear algebra operations (and is great with other areas of maths too)
-   Cheat sheet PDFs of the [definitions](/drive?next=1VdudFWN_SQvWI68XBMjdCNWOYn4lfCfe) and [theorems](/drive?next=1Fohf27v9vTqbQplNJUrnTNd3jFd4bBV1) to save you time in the exam (no need to search through the textbook)
-   [Not All Things ILA - better ila cheat sheet](https://betterinformatics.com/drive?next=10RJf0NRvZGmhMTqmeyv4YKG6Tw41gPhS)
-   **The Exam** - 3 hours - Open Book
    <br>Section A: 40% - 6 questions - conceptual questions, a bit like Tophat
    <br>Section B: 60% - 4 questions (pick 3) - longer, conceptual questions
    <br>You may bring:
    -   the Poole textbook
    -   any non-graphical calculator
    -   any notes (written / printed notes, *nothing bound*)
